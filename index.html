		<p>Hi, everyone! I am a Junior at the <i>University of Michigan</i>, studying UX design. I love to draw and paint 
			in my freetime!
		</p>
		<p>
			I am originally from India, and immigrated to the United States back in 2011. I hope to go 
			into a career in Design, and would love to work in NYC. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Here are a few more fun facts about me!
